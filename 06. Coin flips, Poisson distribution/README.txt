The aim of this lab is to check the Poisson distribution(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution) on real example. 

As an example we will take a flip of coin, but the probability of landing on heads is 0.08 (not 0.5 like the real coin does).
We are flipping such coin 100 times in 100000 trials to get the statistical data. You also can change these values manually.
The results of modeling you can see on figures 1 and 2.
